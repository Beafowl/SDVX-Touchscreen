# SDVX Touchscreen

On 10th Sep 2025, the panel found in the touch screens of the SDVX valkyrie cabinets have been introduced
to SDVX Konaste. The panel was a picture in picture embedded into the game, which means that the panel
could not be dragged as a window to another screen.

This application aims to simulate the touch screen found in the SDVX valkyrie cabinets by mirroring the panel
to an application.
